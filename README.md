 FUTURE IDEAS



Since we are a small team (just me) we can't do everything by launch day, but these are our future ideas that we want to do.

Make a Google Forms to add paintings, remove licensed content, or any ideas
Make structures to show paintings, like museums
Make the project open source in GitHub
Make a WebSite, like my mod Elemental Tools & Dimensions (Visit it in my profile)
Show photos in the site project (CurseForge)
